Spring Pet Clinic from Scratch




/*
* SOLID principles of OOP
* March 95 Uncle Bob 
* proper Dependecy mgmt leads to poor quality Code that is Easy to maintain
* 
* Single Responsibility Principle
* Just Because you can doesn't mean you should
* 1. Every Class Should have a Single responsobility 
* 2. There should never be more than one reason for a class to change
* 3. your classes should be small. No more than Screen full of code
* 4. Avoid GOD classes
* 5. Split Big classes into smaller
*
* Open/Closed Principle
* 1. Class should be open for extension
* 2. But closed for Modification
* 3. should be able to extend a classes behaviour without Modifying it.
* 4. Use Private variables and getters and Setters only when we need
* 5. Use abstract base classes
*
* Liskov Subsitituion Principle 
* 1. Objects in a program would be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of program
* 2. Violations will often fail the "is a " test 
* 3. Eg. A square is reactangle
* 4. but Reactangle is not a Square
* 
*  Interface Segregation Principle
*  1. Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific
*  2. Many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface
*  3. keep ur components focused and minimize dependecies between them
*  4. Notice relation to Single responsibility principle i.e avoid god interface
* 
* Dependecy inversion principle
* 1. abstraction should not depend upon details but viceversa should depend
* 2. higher and lower level objects depend on same abstract interaction
